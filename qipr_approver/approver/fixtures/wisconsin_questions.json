If you are unsure, consider contacting your program officer for the funding or funding entity to determine whether the funding source requires a specific level of IRB review and oversight. If the funding source considers the project to constitute human subjects research, this IRB QI/Program Evaluation Self-Certification Tool is not a sufficient indicator of whether IRB review is required.

The latter is an indication that the results may be generalizable. If multiple institutions are conducting the activities, it's less likely that the outcomes will be used for quality improvement or program evaluation at the local institution. As a result, for multi-site projects, this IRB QI/Program Evaluation Self-Certification Tool is not a sufficient indicator of whether IRB review is required. If the answer to this question is \"Yes,\" IRB review may be required. Note that, in some cases, UF personnel work with a community partner on a local QI/program evaluation project; in these instances, a \"not research\" determination may still be applicable. In this case, please contact the Health Sciences IRBs Office for additional guidance.",

    "description": "The focus of this question is to evaluate the primary intent and design of the project.\nSimply publishing or presenting the results of a QI project does not make it research. The key question is what the primary intent of the project is from the outset. If the primary intent of the project is not generalizability (e.g., it is program evaluation/practice improvement related to a specific initiative) OR the project is not designed in a way that the findings would be generalizable (i.e., limitations to project design), then the answer to this question is \"No\".\nThe design of the project plays a key role in determining intent. If the project is standardized using systematic research methodologies with strong external validity in order to obtain reproducible results, then it would be considered research. If the intended outcome is simply to report on what happened at the institution/program, this does not indicate research design or intent as it may or may not be generalizable outside of the institution.",

If there is no intention for disseminating results outside of the institution or program conducting the project, the answer should be \"No\".
