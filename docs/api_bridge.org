* Scenario
Kermit the Frog MD PhD, once his quality improvement project is approved
wants to have it live in the registry. This way others can search it and
see what he has done despite being green.
* Approver Implementation
** DONE Bridge module
CLOSED: [2016-08-05 Fri 16:32]
- [X] Use requests module to make the requests
- [X] mocking use settings.ini for endpoint
- [X] registry endpoints being built from settings.ini
- [X] models have in_registry property
- [X] Transfer models
** DONE Determine the signals that submit data when appropriate
CLOSED: [2016-08-05 Fri 11:33]
  + [X] Option 1: signals
    * [X] find right hooks
      * post save
    * [X] make sure that all_signals connects the signals on app ready
** DONE Api user
CLOSED: [2016-08-05 Fri 11:45]
- [X] fixtures contains the api user
- [X] constants file has right api username
- [X] pushdata grabs the username from constants to make those changes
** TODO Model natural key
Models must contain a natural key in order for the registry database to
look up and add those related objects. [[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/serialization/][Search for "natural key".]] 
- [X] person natural key
- [ ] project natural key
- [ ] tags natural key
- [ ] address natural key
** TODO Related object dependencies
Registry must be able to get related objects that are not in the registry
already. These are most likely already in the registry db but could not be
due to network failure or something.
*** option 1: Pass leaf models first
- [ ] when serializing, make sure related objects are in the registry
- [ ] when adding the model make sure to respond to dependency errors
*** option 2: bidirectional communication
- [ ] approver enpoints so registry can ask for the things it lacks
* Registry Implementation
** TODO Api endpoints
** TODO Make sure that the Approver has to log in or verify its identity
